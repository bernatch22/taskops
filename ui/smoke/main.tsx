/* What the dashboard has to prove, run against a real board payload.
 *
 * This file is the list. It is aimed at the modules `src/main.tsx` bundles, so
 * every assertion below is about the page that actually ships — and the three
 * seams that make it runnable without a browser are used exactly as their
 * authors designed them:
 *
 *   · `Dossier`, exported beside `Drawer`, because `Overlay` is a PORTAL and a
 *     portal renders nothing under `renderToStaticMarkup`. The document is the
 *     part worth asserting on; the portal is not.
 *   · `submit()`, the send rule as a pure function, so "the draft survives a
 *     refusal" is a claim with no DOM in it.
 *   · `overlayStack`, which holds no listener, so "Escape closes the top-most
 *     only" runs under plain node.
 *
 * The payload is the board's own answer (`tests/test_ui.py` builds it from a
 * live `LocalBoard`), never a hand-written shape: a UI that renders a fixture
 * the server would never send is a UI that renders nothing in production, and
 * that was v1's actual failure. `expect` and `expect_board` travel IN the
 * fixture for the same reason — the Python side names the strings it put on the
 * board and this side proves they reached the screen. */

   * lease's, for a board that predates the key. That fallback was correct by
   * construction and had NO test: the branch that wrote it was cut before this
   * harness existed (tk-17d463).
   *
   * The row is assembled HERE rather than taken from the fixture, and that is
   * not the shortcut this file otherwise forbids: the case under test is a
   * payload NO board at this version can produce — `pulse.py::run` always sends
   * the key. There is nowhere else it could come from. What can still be the
   * server's own shape is the row itself, so it is a real `doing` row from the
   * fixture with only the two keys under test set on top of it.
   *
   * `since` is deliberately older than the TTL, which is what makes the two
   * cases distinguishable at all: the floor reads 0s (the payload cannot say
   * more) while the real key reads minutes. Asserting they DIFFER is what
   * would fail if somebody "simplified" `leaseStart` back to `row.since`. */
